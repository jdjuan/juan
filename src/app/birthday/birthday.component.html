    The first part is a casual setting with music, drinks and chatter. We will
    play board games, drinking games, dancing games, and the like. The first
    part will be like any other party.<br /><br />

  <!-- </p> -->
  <p class="smaller" style="text-align: left">
    The second part is aimed at playful exploration. In this part, we will strip
    our clothes to stay in underwear or the kinky attired your chose to put.
    Here you can expect games* like spin the bottle, truth or dare, and the
    like.

  <p class="smaller" style="text-align: left">
    1. Guests are people that Juan knows personally and who he trust to always
    be respectful to one another. <br /><br />
    2. Everyone will be asked to show a PCR test done at the entrance.
    <br /><br />
    3. This is not a sex party. There will be a room available for those would
    like to try it, but it's not the central theme.<br /><br />

  <br /><br />
  <span style="font-weight: 600; text-align: left">Logistics: 🚛</span>
  <!-- </p> -->
  <p class="smaller" style="text-align: left">
    1. Drinks and snacks will be provided throughout the party, but make sure
    you have proper dinner beforehand. <br /><br />
    2. There's no dress code. Come as you feel the most comfortable. For part
    two we expect some people to wear kinky/sexy attires*, but regular underwear
    totally works. <br />
    <br />
    <br /><br />
  </p>
  <p class="even-smaller" style="font-style: italic">
    *If you don't feel comfortable stripping your clothes, you can stay just for
    part one. That's totally fine!
