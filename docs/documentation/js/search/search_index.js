Application Requirements\n1.1 Architectural Drivers\n\nWrite clean and reusable code\nUse best practices\n\n1.2 Features\n\nShow the weather, avg. temperature, and wind strength for 5 cities using the Open Weather Map API\nClicking on an item shows the forecast in the next hours\nMake it a SPA\nAdd charts for enhance UX\n\n1.3 Delivery requirements\n\nDeliver the code in BitBucket\nDocument the technical decisions made\n\n2. Solution Design\n2.1 Technical Selections\n\nAngular 7.2.0: As requested in the exercise\nAngular CLI: As it is the most appropiate way to create an Angular application since it already has opinionated decisiones based on maintainability and scalability\nAngular Material: As it has a library of battle tested components which already satisfy conditions such as: accessibility, responsiveness, and performance\nAngular Router: To guarantee specific routes for every city enabling users to share the weather in a specific city with the URL. Also, to enable lazy loading and preloading strategies.\nAngular HTTP Interceptors: To gracefully handle the addition of headers in the HTTP Request\nLazy Loading: To improve performance of the application for the first load\nCompoDocs: To provide an interactive way to see the documentation\nngx-charts: To provide d3.js-based charts\n\n2.2 Routes\n\n/ = Default route redirects to dashboard\n/dashboard = Default route for showing the weather in the 5 cities\n/dashboard/forecast/:id = Specific route to show the forecast of a given city\n** = Used for unknown address and redirects to a non-found component\n\n2.3 Angular Modules and Components\n\nThe word 'artefact' refers to components, pipes, directives, services, etc.\n\n\nApp Module: Default module for initialization\nDashboard Module: Contains every artefact required to show the weather in the 5 cities\nCore Module: Contains singleton services.\nShared Module: Contains interfaces and components used throughout the application.\nMaterial Module: Imports and exports all the material modules required in the application.\nForecast Module [Lazy Loaded/ Preloaded]: Contains every artefact required to show the forecast of a given city. This module is preloaded, i.e. it is only loaded after the app has successfully rendered.\n\n2.4 Future Features\n\nUnit tests\nCache requests for 10 minutes as per tips listed here\nAdd emoji pipe to show the emoji based on the weather\nShow tooltips the first time a user opens the app as if it were an interactive tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
